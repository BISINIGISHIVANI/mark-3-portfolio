            <strong>It was a year in the making and our very first sustainable food production course has now completed in Cullerne Gardens, the seven acres of land next to The Park here at Findhorn, which grows much of our food.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>The month-long course, in partnership with the University of the Highlands and Islands Moray College, was aimed at young, unemployed adults from the local area, teaching them not only more sustainable methods of food production, but also entrepreneurial skills so they could create their own businesses. The hands-on course combined classroom-based learning at Moray College with practical outdoor lessons at Cullerne Gardens.</p>
          <p>All participants had been unemployed for more than 13 weeks and genuinely wanted to do something to get back into work. Some of them mentioned that, before the course started, they experienced feelings of isolation, lack of confidence and hopelessness due to the challenges over the last 18 months. When we talked to them, many mentioned how much the group experience, new friendships, the hands-on work in Cullerne Gardens, the knowledge they gathered and the certificate they received at the end changed their outlook on life. It gave them the kick they needed to feel empowered and confident to go out into the world again and find a job.

            Here is what the students had to say about the course:</p>
            <ul>
                <p class="primary"style="padding:1rem;line-height:20px">It is like a different world. I am feeling peaceful and happy. Loving the course. All the people are so friendly to you. Even the people on the course I call them all friends. We never knew each other before we went on the course. The only downside of the course is that it is too short. I would recommend it to anyone right now. I can’t thank them enough.<br/>

 

                   I feel more confident and have a new spring in my step. Four months ago I felt anxiety and depression. Now I feel turned around 180 degrees. I will make sure I’ll keep it going and to get back here to Cullerne Garden again. My habits have changed. I was used to quick meals, but now I am eating greens. I am cooking meals from the start. Even my habits have changed for the better. I am more appreciative of things. I feel just happy. I am in a content place. A happy place in my life, which I never felt in the last so many years.
                    <br/>
                     
                    
                    If I feel things are getting to me I just do deep breathing, sitting in the living room, or going for a walk. That is what this place has taught me. So that’s what I am saying, I can not thank everyone enough.
                    
                </br>
